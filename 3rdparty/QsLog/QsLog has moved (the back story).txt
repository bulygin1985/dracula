As you may have noticed, QsLog has been moved to a separate repository. You can find it at https://bitbucket.org/razvanpetru/qslog and contributions are more than welcome!

The reasons for that are twofold:
1. I only used Mercurial for personal projects, and only the basic features. On the other hand I have used git professionally and know it better. I am not passing judgement on which is the more capable tool, but I know which one I am more familiar with, so I will use that one. :-)
Unfortunately bitbucket doesn't offer the possibility of converting a repository, so I decided to create a new one from the latest version of QsLog. In this case I considered "losing" the history as not so important to justify using the hg import tool.
2. The other Qt components aren't so active, so it's confusing to have multiple components in a repo that move at such different speeds.
