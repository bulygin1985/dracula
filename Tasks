Game rules:
Firstly, 4 Hunters and 1 Dracula choose location on card (except sea zones). 
Lord is first, then Doctor, Helsing and Mina. Dracula is last.
Then each of them can move to adjacent city or sea . Dracula can see any hunter locations but Hunter cannot see 
Dracula locations until find them. Last 6 Dracula locations is Dracula Track. Dracula cannot choose location that already exists
on Dracula Track. If Hunter visit Dracula Track and it is not sea => the location opens. If hunter meets
Dracula in city => Dracula health is decreased on 3 (Dracula health = 15). If Dracula chooses sea location => his health is 
decreased on 1. Hunter cannot see Dracula on sea. Sea locations on Dracula Track are always closed. 
If Hunter is on sea zone => he must move to port or another sea zone (i.e. he cannot stay at sea zone). 
Hunter cannot backtrack to a sea zone they have previously been on the same sea voyage.
Day/Night marker increases value at the start of Dracula turn (unless he is in a sea zone)
